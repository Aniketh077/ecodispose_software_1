**Solution 2**: Check WiFi
- Phone and computer MUST be on same WiFi
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting to WiFi

**Solution 3**: Check Backend
- Ensure backend terminal is still running
- Try visiting `http://YOUR_IP:5000` in phone's browser
- You should see a response from the backend

**Solution 4**: Check Firewall
- Windows: Allow Node.js through firewall
- Mac: System Preferences â†’ Security â†’ Firewall â†’ Allow Node

### "QR Code won't scan"

**Solution 1**: Manual Entry
1. In Expo Go app, tap "Enter URL manually"
2. Type the URL shown below the QR code
3. It looks like: `exp://192.168.1.100:8081`

**Solution 2**: Try Different Camera
- On Android, use Expo Go's built-in scanner
- On iOS, try the Camera app

### "App crashes immediately"

**Solution 1**: Clear Cache
1. Stop Expo (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Run: `npm start -c`

**Solution 2**: Reinstall Dependencies
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm start
```

### "White screen" or "Stuck loading"

**Solution**: Reload App
- Shake your phone
- Tap "Reload"

Or press `r` in the terminal where Expo is running
