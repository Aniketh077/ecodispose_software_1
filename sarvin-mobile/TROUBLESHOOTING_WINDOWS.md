# Troubleshooting Guide for Windows

## Issue: "expo-asset cannot be found"

**Fixed!** The missing packages have been installed.

### What Was Fixed

Added the following required Expo packages:
- `expo-asset` - For asset management
- `expo-font` - For font loading
- `expo-constants` - For app constants

These are core Expo packages that were missing from the initial setup.

npm install
```

### Step 2: Start the Mobile App

npm start
```

You should now see:
```

## Common Windows Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Port Already in Use

**Error:** `Port 8081 already in use`

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Kill process on port 8081
netstat -ano | findstr :8081
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F

# Or restart with different port
npx expo start --port 8082
```

### Issue 2: Cannot Find IP Address

**Find your IP:**
```powershell
ipconfig
```

Look for "IPv4 Address" under your WiFi adapter.

Example: `192.168.1.100`

Update `.env`:
```
BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5000
```

### Issue 3: Backend Not Running

**Error:** Cannot connect to backend

**Solution:**

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**
```powershell
cd ..\server
npm start
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Mobile App:**
```powershell
cd sarvin-mobile
npm start
```

### Issue 4: Firewall Blocking Connection

**Solution:**

1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app through firewall"
3. Find Node.js
4. Check both Private and Public
5. Click OK

Or run PowerShell as Administrator:
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Node.js" -Direction Inbound -Program "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" -Action Allow
```

### Issue 5: npm Warnings About Deprecated Packages

**These warnings are safe to ignore:**
```
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6
npm warn deprecated rimraf@3.0.2
```

These are dependency warnings and don't affect your app.

### Issue 6: WiFi Network Issues

**Problem:** Phone can't connect to development server

**Solutions:**

1. **Use Same WiFi:**
   - Phone and PC must be on same network
   - Don't use Guest WiFi
   - Corporate WiFi may block connections

2. **Use Tunnel (if WiFi doesn't work):**
   ```powershell
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```
   This works on any network but is slower.

3. **Check WiFi Isolation:**
   - Some routers have "AP Isolation" enabled
   - This blocks devices from seeing each other
   - Check router settings or use tunnel mode

- **Git Bash**

To change default terminal:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Terminal: Select Default Profile"
3. Choose PowerShell

### Running Commands

**Use PowerShell, not CMD:**
```powershell
# Good (PowerShell)
cd ..\server

# Avoid (CMD - may have issues)
cd ../server
```

## Quick Commands Reference (Windows)

```powershell
# Navigate to mobile app
cd C:\Users\LENOVO\Downloads\mobile\project\sarvin-mobile

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start app
npm start

# Clear cache and start
npx expo start -c

# Check IP address
ipconfig

# Check what's running on port
netstat -ano | findstr :8081
